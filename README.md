# Super-Social Network

Superheroes lead busy lives and travel far and wide to save the world. As a result, they rarely get time to catch up with friends and swap stories. This is why I built the Super-Social Network. Super-Social is an API for a social network web application where superheroes can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create friend lists. It uses a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Express.js for routing.

## Installation
  
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies; then, run `npm start` to invoke the application. This will start the server and sync the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database.


## Usage

Requests to the application's API routes should be structued as follows:

**Users:**
*  GET all users: `localhost:3001/api/users`
*  GET a single user: `localhost:3001/api/users`
*  POST (add) a user: `localhost:3001/api/users`   with body {"username": "*user's user name*", "email": "*user's email address*"}
*  PUT (update) a user: `localhost:3001/api/users/*user id*   with body {"*field to be updated*": "*content of update*"}
*  POST (add) a friend to a user: `localhost:3001/api/users/*user id*/friends/*friend's user id*`
*  DELETE a friend from a user: `localhost:3001/api/users/*user id*/friends/*friend's user id*` 
*  DELETE a user and that user's associated thoughts: `localhost:3001/api/users/*user id* 

**Thoughts:**
*  GET all thoughts: `localhost:3001/api/thoughts`
*  GET a single thought: `localhost:3001/api/thoughts/*thought id*`
*  POST (add) a thought: `localhost:3001/api/thoughts` with {"thoughtText": "*thought content*", "username": "*user's user name*" } 
*  PUT (update) a thought: `localhost:3001/api/thoughts/*thought id*`  with body {"thoughtText": "*thought content*"}
*  DELETE a thought: `localhost:3001/api/thoughts/*thought id*

**Reactions:**
*  POST (add) a reaction to a thought: localhost:3001/api/thoughts/*thought id*/reactions  with body {"reactionBody": "*reaction content*", "username": "*user's user name*"
