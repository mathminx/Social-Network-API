# Super-Social Network

Superheroes lead busy lives and travel far and wide to save the world. As a result, they rarely get time to catch up with friends and swap stories. This is why I built the Super-Social Network. Super-Social is an API for a social network web application where superheroes can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create friend lists. It uses a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Express.js for routing.

Below is a walkthrough video that demonstrates the application's functionality.
